# Addition
In `addition`, your task is to write a program that prompts the user for 2 numbers then prints the sum of those numbers.

# Getting Started
1. Open up a terminal and type `mkdir addition`.
2. Then execute `cd addition`.
3. Create a file `add2.c`

# Implementation Details
 - You should use `get_int` in the `cs50` library to get user input
 - `get_int` returns an int that you should store in a variable.

# How to compile and execute
It's simple! Just run `make add2` and then run `./add2` to execute your code.

# Testing
Make sure your program will respond to the following tests:
- inputting 2 and 4 returns 6
- inputting 3 and 6 returns 9

Don't forget to check with `check50` too!  
Run `check50 daltongit/checks/c/add2`
