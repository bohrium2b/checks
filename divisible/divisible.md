# Divisible
In divisible, your task is to print out every number between `1` and `100` that is divisible
by 6. The first numbers in the sequence should be `6`, `12`, `18` ...
You **don't** need `<cs50.h>`!

# Implementation Details
How should you check if a number is divisible by six? Well, you can repeat through every number
and check, **does it output a whole number**?
If so, then that number is divisible by 6, and you should `print` it out.
