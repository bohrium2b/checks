# Divisible
In divisible, your task is to print out every number between `1` and `100` that is divisible
by 6. The first numbers in the sequence should be `6`, `12`, `18` ...  
You **don't** need `<cs50.h>`!

# How to get started
1. Create a new directory (`mkdir divisible`) and `cd` into it (`cd divisible`).
2. Execute `wget https://github.com/daltongit/checks/raw/c/divisible/divisible.c` to download the distribution code

# Understanding
**You should fill in all of the blanks and everywhere there is a `TODO`.**  


# Implementation Details
How should you check if a number is divisible by six? Well, you can repeat through every number
and check, **does dividing it by six output a whole number**?
If so, then that number is divisible by 6, and you should `print` it out.
